# TODO

## Views
- Tidy up the script tags all around
- Some pages have scripts that execute depending on data sent form the server
  and stuff. This is not needed anymore, it must be changed to use `res.local`.
- Items in the navbar can be automated
- Item in the footer can be automated.
- Addresses must be made absolute throuthout the views (use '/js/file' rather than just 'js/file').
- Some stuff depend on bower components. Change that.
- ES6 code needs to be compiled.
- Setup SASS properly
- Remove refereces to Keystone in the admin view.
- Check that all the links in the views actually work

## Database
- Fix default values and required values in the database
- Add latitude and longitude on property addition


## Future work
- Design a 404 and 505 page
